    <p>We met at Loyola University Chicago in September of 2009. Ashton hailing from Cincinnati, and Leah from Cleveland. Our love grew over Chicago's antique stores, burgers at Moody's Pub, and comedy shows at Chicago's famous improv theaters. Two dorm rooms, six apartments, one snowpocalypse, two cats, one thousand miles, eighty-seven Catans settled, five hundred and thirty-eight boat tours, forty-two thousand lines of code,  two cities, and five years later, it's time to tie the knot!</p>

    <h1>Transit and Accomodations</h1>
    <p>The Oxford Hotel has offered our guests a discounted rate for the weekend. When booking, mention that you'll be in town for the Barren-Kemerling wedding. The Oxford boasts beautiful and mostly original Victorian rooms, The <a href="http://www.theoxfordhotel.com/dining/the-cruise-room/">Cruise Room</a> - a bar that has been unchanged since Prohibition, a full service spa, and, of course, the convenience of location.</p>

    <p>
      The Courtyard Marriott also has a block rate for our guests. The Courtyard Denver Downtown is located on Denver's famous 16th Street Mall, and is a ten minute walk to The Oxford Hotel. Guests can also grab the free 16th Street Mall Ride from the Courtyard which will drop you two blocks from The Oxford. To book with the Marriott, follow <a href="http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Barren%20Kemerling%20Wedding%5Edencd%60BKWBKWA%7CBKWBKWB%60179%60%60false%6011/7/14%6011/9/14%6010/08/2014&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes">this link</a>. Or, call (303) 571-111 and say that you will be in town for the Barren-Kemerling wedding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please keep in mind that to ensure that you receive the block rate at either hotel, you must make your reservation prior to October 8, 2014.
    </p>

    <p>Because Denver is such a walkable city, we do not recommend renting a car unless you plan to explore beyond downtown. Cab rides from DIA to downtown are a flat rate of $55. If you'd like to split a cab with other guests, please contact Leah.  At this time, Denver's public transit offers a <a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/skyride.shtml">"Skyride"</a> to and from DIA to Market Street Station, which is four blocks from The Oxford Hotel. Skyride is $11 cash exact fare.</p>
